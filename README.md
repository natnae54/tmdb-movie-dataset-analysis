# TMDB Movie Dataset Analysis

## Overview

This repository analyzes the TMDB (The Movie Database) dataset to uncover insights into various aspects of the film industry. The analysis covers runtime trends, financial success, correlation between popularity and vote average, preferred genres, and the relationship between budget and revenue.

## Key Findings

### 1. Runtime Trends

The distribution of movie runtimes suggests a concentration between 0 and 200 minutes, with an average runtime of 102.07 minutes. This indicates that a significant number of movies fall within a moderately short to moderate duration range.

### 2. Financial Success

Examining the top 5 movies with the highest revenue emphasizes the impact of directors and release years on a film's commercial success. "Avatar" emerges as the highest-grossing movie, amassing an extraordinary revenue of $2,781,505,847.

### 3. Popularity and Vote Average Correlation

The analysis reveals a positive yet modest correlation (0.21) between movie popularity and vote average. This nuanced relationship underscores the interconnected nature of audience engagement and critical acclaim.

### 4. Preferred Genres

Adventure|Science Fiction|Thriller, Adventure|Drama|Science Fiction, and Science Fiction|Adventure|Thriller are identified as the top 3 genres with the highest average popularity.

### 5. Budget and Revenue Relationship

The strong positive correlation (0.735) between movie budget and revenue emphasizes the crucial role of budgetary considerations in predicting and influencing a movie's commercial success.
